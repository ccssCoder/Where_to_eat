# Where_to_eat

Hey guys, this year isn’t about going to restaurants, meanwhile we can explore some of
them at home and make an order, to get some good food and let our home made “specialties”
rest a while. According to this we will do a little app as a project during Android courses, where
we can explore restaurants and expand the data we have from the BE with our experience.

The goal is to have an app which works (those apps that are crashing or can’t be built are
not accepted) well, we can have a profile, a local database where we can persist our experience,
get data from the BE as mentioned, list it, review it one by one.
